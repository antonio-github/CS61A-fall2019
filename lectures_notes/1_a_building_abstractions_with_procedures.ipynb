There always exists a *global frame* in which bindings are stablished unless we bind names in other frames.\n",

    "\n",
    "In [SICP, sec. 1.1.5] it is introduced the *substitution model*, which is a simplified description of what the interpreter does. It says that to apply a compound procedure to arguments, evaluate the body of the procedure with each formal parameter replace by the corresponding argument. No local frame is used.\n",
