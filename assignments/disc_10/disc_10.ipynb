    "\n",
    "Recall  that  the  reader  component  of  an  interpreter  parses  inputstrings and represents them as data structures in the implementing language. In thiscase, we need to represent Calculator expressions as Python objects. \n",

    "1. Python expression:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Pair('+', Pair(Pair('-', Pair(2, Pair(4, nil)), Pair(6, Pair(8, nil))))\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. The operator is `+`. If the `Pair` is bound to  `p`, I would obtain `+` by `p.first`.\n",
    "3. The operands are the rest of the expression, `Pair('-', Pair(2, Pair(4, nil))`, `Pair(6, Pair(8, nil))`. To obtain the operands:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "operands = []\n",
    "while p.rest is not nil:\n",
    "    operands.append(p.rest.first)\n",
    "    p = p.rest\n",

    "## Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation component of an interpreter determines the type of an expression and executes corresponding evaluation rules.\n",

    "### Q2.1\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For `(+ 2 4 6 8)`:\n",
    "    - 6 calls to `calc_eval`: one for the whole expression and one for each element (operator and operands).\n",
    "    - 1 call to `calc_apply`: sum the four summands.\n",
    "2. For `(+ 2 (* 4 (- 6 8)))`:\n",
    "    - 10 calls to `calc_eval`: 3 for the 3 pairs and 7 for each element.\n",
    "    - 3 calls to `calc_apply`: one for each operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2.2\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We can handle comprison operators with the current form of `calc_eval` function because they are regular call expressions with the same procedures to handle call expressions. Now, we need to add new entries to the built-in OPERATORS in order to evaluate and apply them.\n",
    "2. `and` is a special form, and does not follow `calc_eval` (shortcircuiting). To evaluate and apply it, we need to create new, special procedures.\n",
    "3. Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def calc_eval(exp):\n",
    "    if isinstance(exp, Pair):\n",

    "        else:                       # Call expressions     \n",
    "            return calc_apply(calc_eval(exp.first),list(exp.rest.map(calc_eval)))\n",
    "        elif exp in OPERATORS:          # Names \n",
    "            return OPERATORS[exp]\n",
    "        else:                           # Numbers\n",
    "            return exp\n",
    "\n",
    "# Recursive implementation\n",
    "def eval_and(operands):\n",
    "    if operands.rest is nil:\n",
    "        return calc_eval(operands.first)\n",

    "        return False\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return eval_and(operands.rest)\n",

    "# Iterative implementation\n",
    "def eval_and(operands):\n",
    "    curr, val = operands, True\n",
    "    while curr is not nil:\n",
    "        val = calc_eval(curr.first)\n",

    "## Tail-Call Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "A **tail call** occurs when a function calls another function as its last action of the current frame. In this case, the frame is no longer needed, and we can remove it from memory. Scheme implements tail-call optimization. We say that a recursive function is **tail recursive** if all of its recursive calls are tail calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tail recursive processes can use a constant amount of memory because each recursive call frame does not need to be saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "When trying to identify whether a given function call within the body of a function is a tail call, we look for whether the call expression is in **tail context**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given that each of the following expressions is the last expression in the body ofthe function, the following expressions are tail contexts:\n",
    "- The second or third operand in an `if`expression.\n",
    "- Any of the non-predicate sub-expressions in a `cond` expression (i.e.  the second expression of each clause).\n",
    "- The last operand in an `and` or an `or` expression.\n",
    "- The last operand in a `begin` expression’s body.\n",
    "- The last operand in a `let` expression’s body.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3.1\n",
    "\n",
    "- `question-b`: it contains one recursive calls are in tail context (`if` case). Constant number of frames.\n",
    "- `question-c`: it contains two recursive calls are in tail context (`if` case). Constant number of frames.\n",
    "- `question-d`: it contains two recursive calls are in tail context (`if` case, second and third clauses). It does not have a constant number of frames, because the boolean clause is a recursive call.\n",
    "- `question-e`: it contains two recursive calls are in tail context (`cond` case for the second clause and in the third clause a `begin` case too). It does not have a constant number of frames since the first recursive call (in the sencond clause of `cond`) is not in a tail context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that some functions do not have a base case, so they never terminate execution.\n",
