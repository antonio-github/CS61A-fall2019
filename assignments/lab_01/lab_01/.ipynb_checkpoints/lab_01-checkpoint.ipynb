    "...         print(d)\n",
    "...     print('foo')\n",
    ">>> ab(10, 20)\n",
    "```\n",
    "It would display `5`, then `foo`. The conditions for `if` is true, so `print(c)` is executed and then skips the `elif` clause. Then, always `print('foo')` is evaluated.\n",

    ">>> bake(1, \"mashed potatoes\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "The first call would display: `1` and `29` (`cake` in the first `if` converts to `1` so the second `if` is executed). The second call would display: `mashed potatoes`.\n",
    "\n",
    "I got it wrong: `bake(.,.)` is also evaluated. In both cases `make` is returned, so an aditional `29` and `'mashed potatoes'` are displayed for cases 1 and 2 respectively.\n",
