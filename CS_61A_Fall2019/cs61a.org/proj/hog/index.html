<p>You can get 1 extra credit point by submitting the entire project one day early on <strong>Wednesday, September 11</strong>.</p></blockquote>

<p>In this project, you will develop a simulator and multiple strategies
for the dice game Hog. You will need to use <em>control statements</em> and
<em>higher-order functions</em> together, as described in Sections 1.2 through
1.6 of <a href="http://composingprograms.com/">Composing Programs</a>.</p>


<h3 id="rules">Rules</h3>


<p>In Hog, two players alternate turns trying to be the first to end a turn with
at least 100 total points. On each turn, the current player chooses some number
of dice to roll, up to 10. That player's score for the turn is the sum of the
dice outcomes.</p>

<p>To spice up the game, we will play with some special rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p><strong>Pig Out</strong>. If any of the dice outcomes is a 1, the current player's score
  for the turn is 1.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><em>Example 1</em>: The current player rolls 7 dice, 5 of which are 1's. They
    score 1 point for the turn.</li>
    <li><em>Example 2</em>: The current player rolls 4 dice, all of which are 3's. Since
    Pig Out did not occur, they score 12 points for the turn.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><p><strong>Free Bacon</strong>. A player who chooses to roll zero dice scores points equal to ten minus the minimum of the ones and tens digit of the opponent's score.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><em>Example 1</em>: The opponent has 13 points, and the current player chooses to roll zero dice. The minimum of 1 and 3 is 1, so the current player gains 10 - 1 = 9 points.</li>
    <li><em>Example 2</em>: The opponent has 85 points, and the current player chooses to roll zero dice. The minimum of 8 and 5 is 5, so the current player gains 10 - 5 = 5 points.</li>
    <li><em>Example 3</em>: The opponent has 7 points, and the current player chooses to roll zero dice. The minimum of 0 and 7 is 0, so the current player gains 10 - 0 = 10 points.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><p><strong>Feral Hogs</strong>. If the number of dice you roll is exactly 2 away (absolute difference) from the number of dice you rolled on the previous turn, you get 3 extra points for the turn. Treat the turn before the first turn as rolling 0 dice.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p><em>Example 1:</em></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Both players start out at 0. (0, 0)</li>
      <li>Player 0 rolls 3 dice and gets 1 point. (1, 0)</li>
      <li>Player 1 rolls 4 dice and gets 1 point. (1, 1)</li>
      <li>Player 0 rolls 5 dice and gets 1 point. 5 is 2 away from 3, so they get a bonus of 3. (5, 1)</li>
      <li>Player 1 rolls 2 dice and gets 1 point. 2 is 2 away from 4, so they get a bonus of 3. (5, 5)</li>
      <li>Player 0 rolls 7 dice and gets 1 point. 7 is 2 away from 5, so they get a bonus of 3. (9, 5)</li>
      <li>Player 1 rolls 0 dice and gets 10 points. 0 is 2 away from 2, so they get a bonus of 3. (9, 18)</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><p><em>Example 2:</em></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Both players start out at 0. (0, 0)</li>
      <li>Player 0 rolls 2 dice and gets 3 points. 2 is 2 away from 0, so they get a bonus of 3. (6, 0)</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><p><strong>Swine Swap</strong>. After points for the turn are added to the current player's score, if the first (leftmost) digit of the current player's score multiplied by the last (rightmost) digit of the current player's score are equal to the first (leftmost) digit of the other player's score multiplied by the last (rightmost) digit of the other player's score, then the two scores are swapped. (You can assume that all player scores have 3 digits or fewer.)</p>

  <ul>
    <li><em>Example 1</em>: At the end of a turn, the players have scores of 2 and 4. Since 2 * 2 != 4 * 4, the scores are not swapped.</li>
    <li><em>Example 2</em>: At the end of a turn, the players have scores of 22 and 4. Since 2 * 2 != 4 * 4, the scores are not swapped.</li>
    <li><em>Example 3</em>: At the end of a turn, the players have scores of 28 and 4. Since 2 * 8 == 4 * 4, the scores are swapped.</li>
    <li><em>Example 4</em>: At the end of a turn, the players have scores of 124 and 2. Since 1 * 4 == 2 * 2, the scores are swapped.</li>
    <li><em>Example 5</em>: At the end of a turn, the players have scores of 44 and 28. Since 4 * 4 == 2 * 8, the scores are swapped.</li>
    <li><em>Example 6</em>: At the end of a turn, the players have scores of 2 and 0. Since 2 * 2 != 0 * 0, the scores are not swapped.</li>
    <li><em>Example 7</em>: At the end of a turn, the players have scores of 10 and 0. Since 1 * 0 == 0 * 0, the scores are swapped.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>

<!-- <p>Remember that you can earn an additional bonus point by submitting the
  project at least 24 hours before the deadline.</p> -->



<p>The project is worth 25 points. 22 points are assigned for correctness, 1 point for
submitting Part I by the checkpoint date, and 2 points for the overall
<a href="../../articles/composition.html">composition</a>.</p>


<p>You will turn in the following files:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>hog.py</code></li>
</ul>

<p>You do not need to modify or turn in any other files to complete the
project. To submit the project, run the following command:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok --submit</code></pre>

<p>You will be able to view your submissions on the <a
  href="http://ok.cs61a.org/">Ok dashboard</a>.</p>

<p>For the functions that we ask you to complete, there may be some
initial code that we provide. If you would rather not use that code,
feel free to delete it and start from scratch. You may also add new
function definitions as you see fit.</p>

<p>However, please do <b>not</b> modify any other functions.  Doing so may
result in your code failing our autograder tests. Also, please do not
change any function signatures (names, argument order, or number of
arguments).</p>



<p>Throughout this project, you should be testing the correctness of your code.
It is good practice to test often, so that it is easy to isolate any problems.
However, you should not be testing <i>too</i> often, to allow yourself time to
think through problems.</p>

<p>We have provided an <b>autograder</b> called <code>ok</code> to help you
with testing your code and tracking your progress. The first time you run the
autograder, you will be asked to <b>log in with your Ok account using your web
browser</b>. Please do so. Each time you run <code>ok</code>, it will back up
your work and progress on our servers.</p>

<p>The primary purpose of <code>ok</code> is to test your implementations.</p>

<!-- <p>First, some of the test cases are <i>locked</i>. To unlock tests, run the
following command from your terminal:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -u</code></pre>

<p>This command will start an interactive prompt that looks like:</p>

<pre>

</pre>

<p>At the <code>?</code>, you can type what you expect the output to be. If you
are correct, then this test case will be available the next time you run the
autograder.</p>

<p>The idea is to understand <i>conceptually</i> what your program should do
first, before you start writing any code.</p>

<p>Once you have unlocked some tests and written some code, you can check the
correctness of your program using the tests that you have unlocked:</p>

<pre>python3 ok</pre>

<p>Most of the time, you will want to focus on a particular question. Use the
<code>-q</code> option as directed in the problems below.</p>  -->

<!-- <p>Second, there may be some test cases that are <i>hidden</i>. These test cases are
<b>not</b> run by the command:</p> -->

<!--<pre>python3 ok</pre>-->

<!-- <p>They are only run when you submit:</p> -->

<!-- <pre>python3 ok --submit</pre> -->

<!-- <p> We keep test cases hidden to ensure that you write your code with the intention
of solving the question at hand, not purely to pass the given tests. The hidden
tests will be run when you submit your project. You will receive an email with part of
the autograder results after submitting. However, the autograder has a 15 minute
cooldown period. If you submit before 15 minutes have passed, the autograder will
not run.</p> -->

<p>We recommend that you submit <b>after you finish each
problem</b>. Only your last submission will be graded. It is also useful for us
to have more backups of your code in case you run into a submission issue.</p>

<!--<p>After you run this command, you will receive an email (to the address-->
<!--that you used to sign up for Ok) that has the output from all <i>failed</i>-->
<!--unlocked tests, including hidden tests, along with your score at the bottom. You-->
<!--can continue submitting until you pass all the tests. However, you will receive-->
<!--<b>at most one email every half hour</b>.</p>-->

<!--<p>This buffer period is meant for you and your partner to try and understand-->
<!--where your error comes from, and take some time to think through your code. We-->
<!--encourage you to do this for all projects.</p>-->

<!---
<p>If you are trying to debug a test failure, you can launch an interactive session
after the test is run with:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;q 05 &#x2d;i</code></pre>

<p>This will run the tests and launch an interactive session if a test does not
pass.</p>

<!--- <p>The <code>tests</code> folder is used to store autograder tests, so
<b>do not modify it</b>. You may lose all your unlocking progress if you
do. If you need to get a fresh copy, you can download the
<a href="hog.zip">zip archive</a> and copy it over, but you
will need to start unlocking from scratch.</p> -->

<p>If you do not want us to record a backup of your work or information about
your progress, you can run

<pre>python3 ok --local</pre>


With this option, no information will be sent to our course
servers.

If you want to test your code interactively, you can run

<pre> python3 ok -q [question number] -i </pre>

with the appropriate question number (e.g. <code>01</code>) inserted.
This will run the tests for that question until the first one you failed,
then give you a chance to test the functions you wrote interactively.</p>

<p>You can also use the debug printing feature in OK by writing

<pre> print("DEBUG:", x) </pre>

which will produce an output in your terminal without causing OK tests to fail
with extra output.

<h2 id="graphical-user-interface">Graphical User Interface</h2>


<p>A <strong>graphical user interface</strong> (GUI, for short) is provided for you.
At the moment, it doesn't work because you haven't implemented the
game logic.  Once you complete the <code>play</code> function, you will be able
to play a fully interactive version of Hog!</p>

<p>In order to render the graphics, make sure you have Tkinter, Python's
main graphics library, installed on your computer. Once you've done
that, you can run the GUI from your terminal:</p>

<pre><code>python3 hog_gui.py</code></pre>

<p>Once you complete the project, if you completed the optional Problem 12,
you can play against the final strategy that you've created!</p>

<pre><code>python3 hog_gui.py &#x2d;f</code></pre>

<p>In the first phase, you will develop a simulator for the game of Hog.</p>


<h3 id="problem-0-0-pt">Problem 0 (0 pt)</h3>


<p>The <code>dice.py</code> file represents dice using non-pure zero-argument
functions. These functions are non-pure because they may have
different return values each time they are called. The documentation
of <code>dice.py</code> describes the two different types of dice used in the
project:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dice can be fair, meaning that they produce each possible outcome with equal
  probability. Example: <code>six_sided</code>.</li>
  <li>For testing functions that use dice, deterministic test dice always cycle
  through a fixed sequence of values that are passed as arguments to the
  <code>make_test_dice</code> function.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before we start writing any code, read over the <code>dice.py</code> file and check your
understanding by unlocking the following tests.</p>

<pre><code class="hljs">python3 ok -q 00 -u</code></pre>

<h3 id="problem-1-2-pt">Problem 1 (2 pt)</h3>


<p>Implement the <code>roll_dice</code> function in <code>hog.py</code>. It takes two arguments: a
positive integer called <code>num_rolls</code> giving the number of dice to roll and a
<code>dice</code> function. It returns the number of points scored by rolling the dice that
number of times in a turn: either the sum of the outcomes or 1 (<em>Pig Out</em>).</p>

<blockquote><p>Hint: The Pig Out rule is reproduced below</p></blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><p><strong>Pig Out</strong>. If any of the dice outcomes is a 1, the current player's score
  for the turn is 1.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><em>Example 1</em>: The current player rolls 7 dice, 5 of which are 1's. They
    score 1 point for the turn.</li>
    <li><em>Example 2</em>: The current player rolls 4 dice, all of which are 3's. Since
    Pig Out did not occur, they score 12 points for the turn.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>

<p>To obtain a single outcome of a dice roll, call <code>dice()</code>. You should call
<code>dice()</code> exactly <code>num_rolls</code> times in the body of <code>roll_dice</code>. Remember to call
<code>dice()</code> exactly <code>num_rolls</code> times even if Pig Out happens in the middle of
rolling. In this way, you correctly simulate rolling all the dice together.</p>

<blockquote><p>You can't implement the feral hogs rule in this problem, since <code>roll_dice</code>
doesn't have the previous number of rolls as an argument. It will be implemented
later.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Understand the problem</strong>:</p>

<p>Before writing any code, unlock the tests to verify your understanding of the
question. <strong>Note: you will not be able to test your code using OK until you
unlock the test cases for the corresponding question</strong>.</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;q 01 &#x2d;u</code></pre>

<p><strong>Write code and check your work</strong>:</p>

<p>Once you are done unlocking, begin implementing your solution. You can check
your correctness with:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;q 01</code></pre>

<p><strong>Debugging your code interactively</strong>:</p>

<p>If the tests don't pass, it's time to debug. You can observe the behavior of
your function using Python directly. First, start the Python interpreter and
load the <code>hog.py</code> file.</p>

<pre><code>python3 &#x2d;i hog.py</code></pre>

<p>Then, you can call your <code>roll_dice</code> function on any number of dice you want.
The <code>roll_dice</code> function has a <a href="http://composingprograms.com/pages/14-designing-functions.html#default-argument-values">default argument value</a> for <code>dice</code> that is
a random six-sided dice function. Therefore, the following call to <code>roll_dice</code>
simulates rolling four fair six-sided dice.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; roll_dice(4)</code></pre>

<p>You will find that the previous expression may have a different result each time
you call it, since it is simiulating random dice rolls. You can also use test dice
that fix the outcomes of the dice in advance. For example, rolling twice when you
know that the dice will come up 3 and 4 should give a total outcome of 7.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; fixed_dice = make_test_dice(3, 4)
&gt;&gt;&gt; roll_dice(2, dice=fixed_dice)
7</code></pre>

<blockquote><p>On most systems, you can evaluate the same expression again by pressing the
up arrow, then pressing enter or return. If you want to get the second last,
third last, etc., command you made, press up arrow repeatedly.</p>

<p>If you find a problem, you need to change your <code>hog.py</code> file, save it, quit
Python, start it again, and then start evaluating expressions. Pressing the
up arrow should give you access to your previous expressions, even after
restarting Python.</p></blockquote>

<p>Continue debugging your code and running the <code>ok</code> tests until they all pass. You
should follow this same procedure of understanding the problem, implementing a
solution, testing, and debugging for all the problems on this project.</p>

<blockquote><p>Note: to start the interpreter after the failing test is complete, try running

the test until the first doctest that fails.</p></blockquote>

<p>Implement the <code>take_turn</code> function, which returns the number of points scored

<p>You will need to implement the <em>Free Bacon</em> rule based on <code>opponent_score</code>, which
you can assume is less than 100.</p>

<blockquote><p>Hint: The Free Bacon rule is reproduced below</p></blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><p><strong>Free Bacon</strong>. A player who chooses to roll zero dice scores points equal to ten minus the minimum of the ones and tens digit of the opponent's score.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><em>Example 1</em>: The opponent has 13 points, and the current player chooses to roll zero dice. The minimum of 1 and 3 is 1, so the current player gains 10 - 1 = 9 points.</li>
    <li><em>Example 2</em>: The opponent has 85 points, and the current player chooses to roll zero dice. The minimum of 8 and 5 is 5, so the current player gains 10 - 5 = 5 points.</li>

<p>Implement <code>is_swap</code>, which returns whether or not the scores should be
swapped, according to rules.</p>

<blockquote><p>Hint: The Swine Swap rule is reproduced below</p></blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><p><strong>Swine Swap</strong>. After points for the turn are added to the current player's score, if the first (leftmost) digit of the current player's score multiplied by the last (rightmost) digit of the current player's score are equal to the first (leftmost) digit of the other player's score multiplied by the last (rightmost) digit of the other player's score, then the two scores are swapped. (You can assume that all player scores have 3 digits or fewer.)</p>

  <ul>
    <li><em>Example 1</em>: At the end of a turn, the players have scores of 2 and 4. Since 2 * 2 != 4 * 4, the scores are not swapped.</li>
    <li><em>Example 2</em>: At the end of a turn, the players have scores of 22 and 4. Since 2 * 2 != 4 * 4, the scores are not swapped.</li>
    <li><em>Example 3</em>: At the end of a turn, the players have scores of 28 and 4. Since 2 * 8 == 4 * 4, the scores are swapped.</li>
    <li><em>Example 4</em>: At the end of a turn, the players have scores of 124 and 2. Since 1 * 4 == 2 * 2, the scores are swapped.</li>
    <li><em>Example 5</em>: At the end of a turn, the players have scores of 44 and 28. Since 4 * 4 == 2 * 8, the scores are swapped.</li>
    <li><em>Example 6</em>: At the end of a turn, the players have scores of 2 and 0. Since 2 * 2 != 0 * 0, the scores are not swapped.</li>
    <li><em>Example 7</em>: At the end of a turn, the players have scores of 10 and 0. Since 1 * 0 == 0 * 0, the scores are swapped.</li>
  </ul></li>

<h3 id="problem-5a-2-pt">Problem 5a (2 pt)</h3>


<p>Implement the <code>play</code> function, which simulates a full game of Hog. Players
alternate turns rolling dice until one of the players reaches the <code>goal</code> score.</p>

<p>You can ignore the <strong>Feral Hogs</strong> rule and <code>feral_hogs</code> argument for now;
You'll implement it in Problem 5b.</p>

<p>To determine how much dice are rolled each turn, each player uses their
respective strategy (Player 0 uses <code>strategy0</code> and Player 1 uses <code>strategy1</code>).
A <em>strategy</em> is a function that, given a player's score and their opponent's
score, returns the number of dice that the current player wants to roll in the
turn. Each strategy function should be called only once per turn. Don't worry
about the details of implementing strategies yet. You will develop them in
Phase 3.</p>

<p>When the game ends, <code>play</code> returns the final total scores of both players, with
Player 0's score first, and Player 1's score second.</p>

<p>Here are some hints:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You should use the functions you have already written! You will need to call
  <code>take_turn</code> with all three arguments.</li>
  <li>Only call <code>take_turn</code> once per turn.</li>
  <li>Enforce all the special rules except for feral hogs</li>
  <li>You can get the number of the other player (either 0 or 1) by calling
  the provided function <code>other</code>.</li>

<p>Now, implement the Feral Hogs rule. When <code>play</code> is called <strong>and</strong> its

<code>feral_hogs</code> is <code>False</code>, this rule should be ignored.
(That way, test cases for 5a will still pass after you solve 5b.)</p>

<blockquote><p>Hint: The Feral Hogs rule is reproduced below</p></blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><p><strong>Feral Hogs</strong>. If the number of dice you roll is exactly 2 away (absolute difference) from the number of dice you rolled on the previous turn, you get 3 extra points for the turn. Treat the turn before the first turn as rolling 0 dice.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p><em>Example 1:</em></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Both players start out at 0. (0, 0)</li>
      <li>Player 0 rolls 3 dice and gets 1 point. (1, 0)</li>
      <li>Player 1 rolls 4 dice and gets 1 point. (1, 1)</li>
      <li>Player 0 rolls 5 dice and gets 1 point. 5 is 2 away from 3, so they get a bonus of 3. (5, 1)</li>
      <li>Player 1 rolls 2 dice and gets 1 point. 2 is 2 away from 4, so they get a bonus of 3. (5, 5)</li>
      <li>Player 0 rolls 7 dice and gets 1 point. 7 is 2 away from 5, so they get a bonus of 3. (9, 5)</li>
      <li>Player 1 rolls 0 dice and gets 10 points. 0 is 2 away from 2, so they get a bonus of 3. (9, 18)</li>

installed, you'll need to install it first before you can run the GUI.</p>

<p>The GUI relies on your implementation, so if you have any bugs in your
code, they will be reflected in the GUI. This means you can also use
the GUI as a debugging tool; however, it's better to run the tests
first.</p>

<h2 id="phase-2-commentary">Phase 2: Commentary</h2>


<blockquote><p>You can work on and submit Phase 2 and 3 with a partner! Make sure one of you
submits and then lists the other as a partner on okpy.org</p></blockquote>

<p>In the second phase, you will implement commentary functions that print remarks
about the game after each turn, such as, <code>&quot;22 points! That&#x27;s the biggest gain yet
for Player 1.&quot;</code></p>

<p>A commentary function takes two arguments, Player 0's current score and Player
1's current score. It can print out commentary based on either or both current
scores and possibly even previous scores. Since commentary can differ from turn
to turn depending on the current point situation in the game, commentary functions
return another commentary function to be called on the next turn. The only side
effect of a commentary function should be to print.</p>


<h3 id="commentary-examples">Commentary examples</h3>


<p>The function <code>say_scores</code> in <code>hog.py</code> is an example of a commentary function
that simply announces both players' scores. Note that <code>say_scores</code> returns
itself, meaning that the same commentary function will be called each turn.</p>

<pre><code>def say_scores(score0, score1):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;A commentary function that announces the score for each player.&quot;&quot;&quot;
    print(&quot;Player 0 now has&quot;, score0, &quot;and Player 1 now has&quot;, score1)
    return say_scores</code></pre>

<p>The function <code>announce_lead_changes</code> is an example of a higher-order function
that returns a commentary function that tracks lead changes.</p>

<pre><code>def announce_lead_changes(previous_leader=None):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Return a commentary function that announces lead changes.

    &gt;&gt;&gt; f0 = announce_lead_changes()
    &gt;&gt;&gt; f1 = f0(5, 0)
    Player 0 takes the lead by 5
    &gt;&gt;&gt; f2 = f1(5, 12)
    Player 1 takes the lead by 7
    &gt;&gt;&gt; f3 = f2(8, 12)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; f4 = f3(8, 13)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; f5 = f4(15, 13)
    Player 0 takes the lead by 2
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    def say(score0, score1):
        if score0 &gt; score1:
            leader = 0
        elif score1 &gt; score0:
            leader = 1
        else:
            leader = None
        if leader != None and leader != previous_leader:
            print(&#x27;Player&#x27;, leader, &#x27;takes the lead by&#x27;, abs(score0 &#x2d; score1))
        return announce_lead_changes(leader)
    return say</code></pre>

<p>You should also understand the function <code>both</code>, which takes two commentary
functions (<code>f</code> and <code>g</code>) and returns a <em>new</em> commentary function. This returned
commentary function returns <em>another</em> commentary function which calls the functions
returned by calling <code>f</code> and <code>g</code>, in that order.</p>

<pre><code>def both(f, g):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Return a commentary function that says what f says, then what g says.

    NOTE: the following game is not possible under the rules, it&#x27;s just
    an example for the sake of the doctest

    &gt;&gt;&gt; h0 = both(say_scores, announce_lead_changes())
    &gt;&gt;&gt; h1 = h0(10, 0)
    Player 0 now has 10 and Player 1 now has 0
    Player 0 takes the lead by 10
    &gt;&gt;&gt; h2 = h1(10, 6)
    Player 0 now has 10 and Player 1 now has 6
    &gt;&gt;&gt; h3 = h2(6, 17)
    Player 0 now has 6 and Player 1 now has 17
    Player 1 takes the lead by 11
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    def say(score0, score1):
        return both(f(score0, score1), g(score0, score1))
    return say</code></pre>


<h3 id="problem-6-2-pt">Problem 6 (2 pt)</h3>


<p>Update your <code>play</code> function so that a commentary function is called at the end
of each turn. The return value of calling a commentary function gives you the
commentary function to call on the next turn.</p>

<p>For example, <code>say(score0, score1)</code> should be called at the end of the first
turn. Its return value (another commentary function) should be called at the end
of the second turn. Each consecutive turn, call the function that was returned
by the call to the previous turn's commentary function.</p>

<h3 id="problem-7-3-pt">Problem 7 (3 pt)</h3>


<p>Implement the <code>announce_highest</code> function, which is a higher-order function that
returns a commentary function. This commentary function announces whenever a
particular player gains more points in a turn than ever before. To compute the
gain, it must compare the score from last turn to the score from this turn for
the player of interest, which is designated by the <code>who</code> argument. This function
must also keep track of the highest gain for the player so far.</p>

<p>The way in which <code>announce_highest</code> announces is very specific, and your
implementation should match the doctests provided. Don't worry about singular
versus plural when announcing point gains; you should simply use "point(s)" for
both cases.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Hint.</strong> The <code>announce_lead_changes</code> function provided to you is an example of
how to keep track of information using commentary functions. If you are stuck,
first make sure you understand how <code>announce_lead_changes</code> works.</p></blockquote>

<br>

<blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> The doctests for <code>both</code>/<code>announce_highest</code> in hog.py might describe
a game that can't occur according to the rules. This shouldn't be an issue for
commentary functions since they don't implement any of the rules of the game.</p></blockquote>

<br>

<blockquote><p><strong>Hint.</strong> If you're getting a <code>local variable [var] reference before assignment</code> error:</p>

<p>This happens because in Python, you aren't normally allowed to modify variables defined in parent frames. Instead of reassigning <code>[var]</code>, the interpreter thinks you're trying to define a new variable within the current frame. We'll learn about how to work around this in a future lecture, but it is not required for this problem.</p>

<p>To fix this, you have two options:</p>

<p>1) Rather than reassigning <code>[var]</code> to its new value, create a new variable to hold that new value. Use that new variable in future calculations.</p>

<p>2) For this problem specifically, avoid this issue entirely by not modifying/defining additional variables and instead using a built-in function to calculate your desired value when creating the new commentary function.</p></blockquote>

<p>Great work! You just finished Phase 2 of the project!</p>


<h2 id="phase-3-strategies">Phase 3: Strategies</h2>


<p>In the third phase, you will experiment with ways to improve upon the basic
strategy of always rolling a fixed number of dice. First, you need to develop
some tools to evaluate strategies.</p>


<h3 id="problem-8-2-pt">Problem 8 (2 pt)</h3>


<p>Implement the <code>make_averaged</code> function, which is a higher-order function that
takes a function <code>fn</code> as an argument. It returns another function that takes
the same number of arguments as <code>fn</code> (the function originally passed into
<code>make_averaged</code>). This returned function differs from the input function in that
it returns the average value of repeatedly calling <code>fn</code> on the same arguments.
This function should call <code>fn</code> a total of <code>num_samples</code> times and return the
average of the results.</p>

<p>To implement this function, you need a new piece of Python syntax! You
must write a function that accepts an arbitrary number of arguments,
then calls another function using exactly those arguments. Here's how
it works.</p>

<p>Instead of listing formal parameters for a function, you can write <code>*args</code>. To
call another function using exactly those arguments, you call it again with
<code>*args</code>. For example,</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def printed(fn):
...     def print_and_return(*args):
...         result = fn(*args)
...         print(&#x27;Result:&#x27;, result)
...         return result
...     return print_and_return
&gt;&gt;&gt; printed_pow = printed(pow)
&gt;&gt;&gt; printed_pow(2, 8)

256
&gt;&gt;&gt; printed_abs = printed(abs)
&gt;&gt;&gt; printed_abs(&#x2d;10)

score for a turn.  Your implementation should use <code>make_averaged</code> and
<code>roll_dice</code>.</p>

lower number. For example, if both 3 and 6 achieve a maximum average score,
return 3.</p>

<p><strong>Running experiments</strong> For the remainder of this project, you can change the
implementation of <code>run_experiments</code> as you wish.  By calling
<code>average_win_rate</code>, you can evaluate various Hog strategies. For example,
change the first <code>if False:</code> to <code>if True:</code> in order to evaluate
<code>always_roll(6)</code> against the baseline strategy of <code>always_roll(4)</code>.</p>

<p>Some of the experiments may take up to a minute to run. You can always reduce
the number of samples in your call to <code>make_averaged</code> to speed up experiments.</p>

<p>A strategy can also take advantage of the <em>Swine Swap</em> rule. The swap strategy always
rolls 0 if doing so triggers a beneficial swap and always avoids rolling 0 if doing
so triggers a detrimental swap. In other cases, it rolls 0 if rolling 0 would give
<strong>at least</strong> <code>margin</code> points. Otherwise, the strategy rolls <code>num_rolls</code>.</p>

  <li><code>swap_strategy</code> is a good default strategy to start with.</li>
  <li>There's no point in scoring more than 100. Check whether you can win by

  <li>Try to force a beneficial swap rolling more than 0 dice.</li>
  <li>Choose the <code>num_rolls</code> and <code>margin</code> arguments carefully.</li>

<p>Once you are satisfied, submit to Ok to complete the project.</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;&#x2d;submit</code></pre>

<p>If you have a partner, make sure to add them to the submission on okpy.org.</p>

<p>Check to make sure that you did all the problems by running</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;&#x2d;score</code></pre>

<p>You can also play against your final strategy with the graphical user
interface:</p>

<pre><code>python3 hog_gui.py &#x2d;f</code></pre>

<p>The GUI will alternate which player is controlled by you.</p>

<p>Congratulations, you have reached the end of your first CS 61A project! If you
haven't already, relax and enjoy a few games of Hog with a friend.</p>
