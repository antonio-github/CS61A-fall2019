# CS61A-fall2019

Repository for self-learning the course [CS61A (fall 2019): Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa19/).

## Overview of CS61A

*Extracted and slightly modified from https://cs61a.org/articles/about.html*

**The CS61 Series**. The CS61 series is an introduction to Computer Science, with particular emphasis on software and on machines from a programmer's point of view.  
1. CS61A concentrates on the idea of abstraction, allowing the programmer to think in terms appropriate to the problem rather than in low-level operations dictated by the computer hardware.
2. CS61B deals with the more advanced engineering aspects of software, such as constructing and analyzing large programs.
3. CS61C focuses on machines and how they execute the programs you write.

**Competences and Skills Acquired**. In CS61A, we are interested in teaching you about programming, not about how to use one particular programming language. We consider a series of techniques for controlling program complexity, such as functional and declarative programming, recursion, higher order functions, data abstraction, mutable data, object-oriented programming, and exception handling. Also, introductory concepts of interpreters are taught and applied with the construction of a Scheme interpreter using Python.

**Programming Languages**. Mastery of a particular programming language is a very useful side effect of CS61A. However, our goal is not to dictate what language you use in your future endeavors. Instead, our hope is that once you have learned the concepts involved in programming, you will find that picking up a new programming language is but a few days' work. CS61A primarily uses the Python 3 programming language. We will also use two other languages in the latter half of the course: the Scheme programming language and the Structured Query Language (SQL).

## About the Repository

The repository is divided into three folders.
- `CS_61A_Fall2019/cs61a.org/`: contains the assignments to be done during the course as well as solutions to most of them given by the CS61A staff.
- `assignments`: contains my solutions to the assignments. Sometimes several solutions, comments and insights are included. When provided, the `ok` autograder is included to check the correctness of the code. If not provided, I added some extra testing. Almost all assignments, either compulsory or optional, are done. Some of them, like the exams, are done with pen and paper (and thus, not uploaded).
- `lecture_notes`. I did the lecture notes based on the book [Composing Programs](composingprograms.com) and extended when needed (using the original SICP book, StackExchange, etc.).

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank to UC Berkeley and John DeNero for offering publicly and freely the resources for CS61A, so that everyone in the planet can (self-)learn the basics of Computer Science.
